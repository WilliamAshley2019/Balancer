This vst3 plugin is a basic gain knob plugin that also includes a concept of adding in stereo to mono sum toggle that can be turned on or off so you can not only balance the level but also stereo sum to mono.
It does appear to merge the audio signal and the gain seems to work. 

This was a quick build so I've only tested it once.

To build from source you will need Steinbergs VST3 SDK as well as JUCE etc.. if you are building a project I am guessing you know how to build and compile. 

The source is Open Source GPL3. 

Steinberg (I think owned by Yamaha) developed VST as a virtual studio technology to enbable computers to run software that acted like hardware. They use it as a trademark, which is registered in Europe. 

This project requires JUCE to build from source, and JUCE requires the VST3 SDK to build VST3 plugins. Default plugin basics modules are enough to build this project.

Just drop the vst3 into your commonfiles/vst3 folder and it should work.

This plugin is made for windows 11 as I am a windows user it may work in other versions of windows but hasn't been tested in them.

EULA - Enduser assume all risk in using the vst3 or source code. I have tested it and it works for me, use your own due dilligence in using the vst3, it was made in good faith to provide a simple easy to use no BS gain and stereo to mono sum tool.

This is an alpha.
