This vst3 plugin is a basic gain knob plugin that also includes a concept of adding in stereo to mono sum toggle that can be turned on or off so you can not only balance the level but also stereo sum to mono.
It does appear to merge the audio signal and the gain seems to work. 

This was a quick build so I've only tested it once.

To build from source you will need Steinbergs VST3 SDK as well as JUCE etc.. if you are building a project I am guessing you know how to build and compile. 

The source is Open Source GPL3. 

Steinberg (I think owned by Yamaha) developed VST as a virtual studio technology to enbable computers to run software that acted like hardware. They use it as a trademark, which is registered in Europe. 

This project requires JUCE, and JUCE requires the VST3 SDK to build VST3 plugins.
